# 🎬 FindYourMoviee

**FindYourMoviee** is a sleek and responsive web application built with **React + Vite** that helps users discover movies based on their preferences. It uses the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/discover-movie) to fetch real-time movie data and integrates **Appwrite** to track how often a movie is searched, enabling a **Trending Movies** section based on user interactions.

> ⚠️ This project was built by following a tutorial by [JS Mastery](https://youtu.be/dCLhUialKPQ?si=yp1PkTwC9gZX7KOJ), and is not an original concept implementation.
